What you did. What are the controls? why this design?

For this project I decided to create a 360 degree virual concert. When I first heard that this assignment was based mostly on creating and destroying elements and sound effects I immediatly thought of a concert. The basic premise is you can press a bunch of different buttons and each one will start playing a different instrument. Combine these instruments together and make your own song! 

I chose to go with the WASD controls to move because that I feel is the most common and what people are used to. In terms of interactions I opted to use the mouse (or touch) rather than a VR controller input due to lack of experience with those controllers. I decided to make the interaction a button click so that it would be extremely easy to tell whether a specific instrument is playing, and because it is easy for a user to do.

Creating my scene at the beginning was an extremely smooth process and I am proud of what I've been able to accomplish given the timelines. I even managed to add in some animations which was a stretch goal of mine for this assignment. It got much more difficult as I moved into creating interactions with javascript logic and even harder as I started targeting and editing three.js data to move objects around my scene. To solve problems associated to these I looked through the A-frame documentation pages.
